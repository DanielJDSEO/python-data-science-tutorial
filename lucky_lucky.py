#I am going to re-create what I've done for Blackjack so far but I'm going to build the Lucky Lucky minigame first. This will be much easier to simulate
# because the game rules are simpler. I will take this opportunity to re-create the class objects using additional things I've learned from watching
# Precipio videos (special methods, the property decorator, getters/setters, subclasses, class vs. instance variables, etc.)

#Now that I've made the instance variables 'private', I'm having trouble drawing a card from the Shoe instance.
# I want to re-write the code so that Card objects are created and placed into the Shoe object, and then the Dealer and Player draw 
# the Card objects from the Shoe object. Then, I want evaluations performed on the Card objects that the Dealer and Player are holding.
